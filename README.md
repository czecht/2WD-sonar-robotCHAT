2WD_4_19_2024.ino - Sketch for arduino. I made this sketch with ChatGPT.
2WD Robot Chassis (multi-purpose) by Torsten JÃ¤ger _ Download free STL model _ Printables.com.html  - You can download this if you have 3D printer to house the robot.
SMALL-ServoHolder-final.stl - I made this file for small servo for people who have a 3D printer. Otherwise use hot glue.
Sonar-holder-4-one-sonar-final.svg - I made this file for people with laser cutter to cut and glue together for Sonar holder.
HOSYOND-2WDsonarRobot.zip  -  Kit from Amazon.com that has everything included and info how to find schema, wiring and several test files. (I'll upload a video later this week)

Some parts include 2 to 4 parts because it was the best price for me. You need only one of each.
In my project I used 2x 18650 batteries and battery holder, but you can use the AA battery holder that comes with the kit.
At the end video I took some pictures so you can wire the project as I did, but I'll also explain in video about the wiring.
